Intro to Strings
----------------

Strings are Sequences of Characters wrapped in single quotes or double quotes

'Hello'
"World"

If one of your words contains a single quote as an apostrophe you should wrap the string in double quotes

"I don't like poo"

Strings are ordered sequences. This means we can use indexin and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string/

--------
Indexing
--------

Indexing notation uses [] notation after the string or variable assigned to the string.

Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string.

This means every single character has a seperate index e.g:

          Str   h   e   l   l   o
        index   0   1   2   3   4
reverse index   0   -4  -3  -2  -1

Python is a 0 indexed language (Like JavaScript Arrays)

You can use reverse indexing in python e.g. ig you wanted to grab the last letter of the above string you could use -1, rather than 4

--------
Slicing
--------

Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters. 

Slicing has the following syntax:
  - [start:stop:step]
  - start: this is the start of
