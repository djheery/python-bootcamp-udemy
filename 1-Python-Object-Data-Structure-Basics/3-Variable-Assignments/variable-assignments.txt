Variables

Variables are pointers to specific items in memory to be referenced throughout your code.

Rules for Variable names in Python

- Names cannot start with a Numbers
- There can be no spaces in the name 
  - You should use an underscore instead i.e NEW_VARIABLE 
- You cannot use most of the special characters
- Generally considerd best practice for lowercase variables (Gloabl Variables could be Uppercase)
- Avoid using reserved names (list, int)

Python uses dynamic typing which means you can reassign variables to different data Types
This is differ to statically typed languages which ill lock the data type of a variable.

Example:

my_name = 2
my_name = [hello, 2, 5]

Pros & Cons

pros:
  - Avoids Writing Types
  - Easier to work with
  - Faster Development time
cons: 
  - May result in unexpected bugs due to data Types
  - You need to be aware of type()

You can use the inbuilt type() function to check the type of any variable
